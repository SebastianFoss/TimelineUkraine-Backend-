                <p><small>Finding accurate, relevant, and "straight to the point" news on the internet is often times difficult, due to source bias, misinformation, hidden agendas, or sometimes simply a lack of information as a whole because the topic no longer appeals to the algorithm. TimelineUkraine is an attempt to combat this by relying on only trusted sources, student volunteer writers, and focusing only on events in Ukraine, even when in disregard to shifts in popular attention (which in recent times have proven to come quickly). TimelineUkraine is still in development, and there will be many features to come, so please send any feedback you would like to provide.

The additional 500 million euros brings the EU to a total of 1.5 billion euros in aid to Ukrainian armed forces.

          <strong>-Shift in Russian Strategy-</strong>
  
          <p>Currently a 8 mile long Russian convoy is headed to the Donbas region of Ukraine, signaling a shift in Russian strategy. With major resistance and failure to capture Kyiv, Russian forces have focused on the eastern region. Pushing up through Crimea and down through Northern Ukraine, it seems their strategy has shifted to encircling eastern Ukrainian forces and capturing the region. This new approach has the potential to bring a longer and deadlier conflict, with civilians being the most at risk.</p>

          <p>As Sweden and Finland are looking towards joining NATO as early as June of this year, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned the countries against joining the alliance, as he claimed that joining NATO would not help in stabilizing Europe. He also said that “the alliance remains a tool geared towards confrontation". In response to the claims, US defense officials said that the invasion of Ukraine was a “massive strategic blunder” that would lead to NATO enlargement. Washington is also believed to be supporting the addition of the two countries, as the alliance would then grow to 32 members.

          <p>Microsoft recently seized seven domains linked to Russian hackers. According to Microsoft, the sites were operated by Strontium, a group with close ties to the Russian government. The sites were used to target Ukrainian media outlets and government agencies in the US and EU. Siezed servers are now being redirected to a sinkhole, where cybersecurity experts can analyze malicious connections. Furthermore, security vendor WatchGuard fixed a vulnerability in its firewall that was exploited by Russian hackers. The flaw was used by Russian spies to create a bot net using Cyclops Blink malware. After the exploit was reported by the FBI, security analysts blasted WatchGuard for their attempts to cover up the extent of damages. The company waited 8 months to release an official public vulnerability announcement, and company representatives have refused to comment on the inexplicable and dangerous delay.</p>

                <p>
                  As the war rages on the battlefield, all is not quiet on the cyber front. Russian hackers have recently taken to targeting Facebook. With large swaths of bot accounts, Russian computer operatives are spreading propaganda and encouraging hate towards Ukraine. On top of this, many Russian affiliated accounts have been sending false reports to Facebook about content violations. Their goal? Silence Ukraine by closing or hindering their means of communication. That is not the worst of it though. According to Mandiant, Hackers known as Ghostwriter have been attempting to breach the Facebook accounts of Ukraine military personnel. On breached accounts, they have posted false narratives of Ukrainian surrender and weakness in order to lower morale. In Meta’s Q1 Adversarial Threat Report, they have claimed to block such attempts, and have linked Ghostwriter to Belarus (a Russian sympathetic country). Regardless, the group has had multiple successful breaches, and defense efforts are ongoing. With Russia gaining little progress, developments in the cyberspace will continue to be deployed for the foreseeable future.

          <strong> Global food shortage </strong>
  
          <p>Due to war sanctions, global food shortages might be a coming problem. Ukraine and Russia produce around 14% of the world's wheat and accounts for around 28% of the wheat global market. Currently, 13.5 million tons of wheat and 16 million tons of corn are stuck in Russia and Ukraine because of these sanctions. Ukraine and Russia also export around 28% of fertilizers made from phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium which would worsen the global food situation. Around 2 weeks ago President Biden warns of “real” food shortages and Vladimir Putin warns western nations how sanctions will cause food shortages in the “poorest regions of the world”.</p>

            <p>In Bucha, a city northwest of Kyiv, alleged war crimes have taken place. Witnesses have said that Russian soldiers have rounded up and executed civilians, including those trying to flee the city. More than 300 civilians were murdered before a Russian withdrawal from the city took place. Russia's defense ministry has denied these claims, while president Biden called Putin a “war criminal” for his actions in Bucha.

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky addressed the UN Security Council again, this time with a strong statement: “Where is the security that the security council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council.” In his speech, President Zelensky talked about the images of bodies in the streets of Kyiv, how Russia is no different from a terrorist group, and how Russia has the power to veto in the security council, although it is Russia that is invading Ukraine. He claimed that one of two things should happen: either Russia doesn’t have the right to veto against decisions made against its own aggression, or the UN Security Council should “dissolve”.</p>

          <strong>-War Crimes in Ukraine- </strong>
  
          <p>War crimes committed in the Kyiv area are becoming very apparent with the Russian withdrawal. Evidence of rape and other forms of assault litter the streets. Body piles of civilians executed by Russians are yet to be buried. Many of the dead bodies have their hands tied, indicating Russian massacre of the defenseless. Ukrainian soldiers in the area have voiced happiness at reclaiming the city, but know that it is still not safe. Especially since Russian troops booby trapped many of the buildings before their departure.  Although a victory for Ukraine, as Russia shifts its focus to the east, the scale of inhumane actions is devastating, and dogs prowl the streets feeding on carcasses.</p>

          <strong> -Chernobyl withdrawl-</strong>
          <p>According to Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, the Russian forces who occupied Chernobyl have left. Experts believe radiation levels posing risks to Russian troops held in trenches around the plant caused their departure. Although risks of a another nuclear incident are minor (since no nuclear reactor is currently in operation), the greater risk at Chernobyl is a disconnect between different groups in the reporting of hazardous material. Furthermore, recent reports from the British GCHQ hint at Putin  being misinformed. The eavesdropping network claims that advisors are afraid to tell Putin the truth about Ukrainian resistance and Russian military shortcomings. Overall, this statement is a big insult to Putin, a past KGB agent notorious for being well informed.</p>

          <p>Russian troops in Ukraine have been using unsecured communications. With much of Ukrainian infrastructure down, and classified Russian communication methods faltering, the war of intelligence rages on. This could be contributing to the massive loss of Russian military generals on the front line. With over seven Russian generals eliminated (according to Ukraine) through snipers, bombings, and close combat, this is the highest level of death among Russian military officials since WWII. A total of 15 Russian senior commanders have been killed in battle, and Russia’s talk of their justification to use nuclear weapons looms ever closer.  Especially with Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, who now serves as deputy chairman of the country's security council, outlining four ways that Russia could be "entitled to" use its nuclear arsenal.</p>

In response, the FBI issued a notice hinting at specific targeting of 5 energy companies. With recent Russian setbacks and irritation in the Kremlin at high points, the news comes as no surprise.

        <strong> -Russia’s Assault on Mariupol-</strong>
        <p>
        As the Russian military presses closer into the heart of Ukraine, another city is taking the brunt of Putin’s attacks, that of Mariupol. Mariupol is a port city in southeastern Ukraine with over 400,000 citizens that have been at the center of an ongoing humanitarian crisis. It has been the site of a bombed theatre, hospital, and other civilian buildings which have caused over 2300 citizen casualties in the city over the course of the past three weeks alone; where many of the deceased are unable to be buried due to its dangers. The Mariupol city government has also made claims that its citizens were being forcibly deported to Russia through a sports club this weekend. Many citizens are also unable to flee the war-torn zone as railways and roads throughout the region have been severely damaged, and as Russia continues to siege the port city, necessities such as food, water, and good electricity are scarce.
        In a shocking move, Putin has recently delivered a 5am Moscow time deadline (March 21st, 2022)  for surrender from the city’s government, asking to have citizens and troops stop fighting. When this happens, Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev (director of the Russian National Defense Management Center) claims that everyone in the port city will be able to escape and humanitarian corridors will be open to them starting at 10am the next day. What is left to see is Ukraine’s response to the situation.

        <p>Following Russian hacking of the Viacom satellite communications network in Ukraine, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) along with the FBI have been working with providers to increase security. In a joint advisory, both parties voiced concerns over threat to both international and domestic SATCOM networks. Ultimately, the CISA is expanding its Shields Up Initiative to encompass faster and more simple malicious activity reporting. This ties into President Joe Biden’s signing of the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act. The new law requires certain companies to report incidents to the government within 72 hours. Although this could be a step forward in unified American cybersecurity, the effectiveness of new measures remains to be seen.</p>

            Zelensky's speech to the US Congress:

            Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the US Congress, asking for more sanctions on Russias "military machine", and creating a no fly zone over Ukraine. During his speech, President Zelensky mentioned various different events that took place in America, including the attack of pearl harbor and 9/11/2001, in order to compare what happened in the US and what is happening currently in Ukraine. The phrase, "I have a dream" is said during his speech, an allusion to Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech, who was a leader in the civil rights movement. Although he did request President Biden to create a “no fly zone” in Ukraine, he still imposed an alternative solution that the US could partake in. A “no fly zone” over Ukraine would be the best option, however the US and NATO countries has been hesitant over this because imposing a “no fly zone” over Ukraine could be the spark that ignites WWIII. The alternative solution asked for the US and other NATO countries to provide additional aircraft and jets that could support Ukraine’s effort against Russia, however this has also been tentatively declined. Afterwards, President Zelensky mentioned about a new association (outside of NATO and the United Nations) in which both Ukraine and the US could join, in which the purpose would be to unite “responsible countries” that have the strength to stop conflicts immediately and provide support within 24 hours. President Zelensky finished off his speech, asking President Biden to not only be the leader of his own, “great nation”, but to be the “leader of the world”.

          <p>Over 300,000 volunteer hackers have banded together in an IT Army fighting Russia. The Army is directed through the messaging platform ‘Telegram’ and the group is composed of more than just IT specialists. With many people around the globe supporting Ukraine, the recent success of the IT Army has further spurred its popularity. Members collaborate from across the world (Switzerland, Lithuania, US, etc.) and have disrupted Kremlin websites and other government managed infrastructure. However the security of Ukrainian communications has been brought into question, especially with communication playing a vital role in the defense effort. Russian hacks have taken down much of the Ukrainian communication space: successful Russian targets include Viasat Satellites, internet provider Triolan, and many others. Amidst all this, Ukraine and many other countries are certain that cyber-warfare will continue, and may spread to affect other nations around the globe.<p>

        <p>U.S. Senate passes 1.5 Trillion Dollar Spending Bill passed 68-21: 13.6 Billion to be spent towards aid to Ukraine </p>
          <p>The majority of the United States Federal Government does not want to intervene in the overseas conflict, because NATO involvement could lead to a World War the likes of which we have never seen. But this notion has not stopped America from sending vast amounts of military aid to NATO countries such as Poland to bolster their defenses. In a recent step further, US legislature has as of today passed a 1.5 Trillion dollar defense package including direct aid to Ukraine. This newly passed bill contains 13 billion in direct foreign aid, including 3 billion for Ukrainian Operation Command and Support, 4 billion in Humanitarian Aid, also promising nearly 800 billion in U.S. defense spending(a 42 billion increase in defense spending for the 2022 fiscal year compared to 2021), and nearly 800 billion in non-defense spending </p>

        <p>Scott Morrison, Australia's Prime Minister, declared that amidst this crisis, there is a "moment of choice for China". He also claimed that no country will have enough impact as China to Russia's war against Ukraine. It was noted that days before the war, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin met, agreeing to be in a friendship. Since this meeting between the 2 presidents, China slightly supported Russia's justifications, and declined to impose sanctions on Russia along with the Western countries.</p>
